// Direction-B REPLAY PROTECTION — a single-use nonce store (agency Worker side).
//
// dispatch-verify.ts proves an inbound /actuate job is AUTHENTIC (ed25519) and FRESH
// (±FRESHNESS_WINDOW_SECONDS). But the freshness window ALONE admits replay: a captured
// {job, signature} can be re-POSTed any number of times inside that window and each copy
// re-verifies identically. This Durable Object closes that hole by remembering every nonce
// it has already accepted, so the SECOND POST of the same signed job is rejected before any
// side effect ever runs.
//
// WHY A DURABLE OBJECT (not module scope / KV): the spent-nonce set must be shared and
// strongly consistent across every edge isolate and request. Module scope is per-isolate
// and evaporates on eviction — useless as a replay guard. KV is eventually consistent, so a
// racing replay could slip through before a write propagates. A DO gives a single-threaded,
// strongly-consistent home, and its SQLite storage (state.storage.sql) persists the set
// across DO restarts/evictions so a spent nonce is never forgotten while it could still be
// replayed.
//
// THROUGHPUT TRADEOFF: /actuate addresses ONE singleton instance (idFromName("dirb-nonce")),
// so every actuation serializes through it. Actuation is low-QPS / admin-triggered, so a
// single instance is deliberately fine here. If actuation ever becomes high-QPS, shard by
// hashing the nonce across N named instances — each nonce still lands on exactly one
// instance, preserving the single-use guarantee.
//
// Worker-native only: DO SQLite is native to workerd, so this needs no nodejs_compat.

// Extra seconds a consumed nonce is retained BEYOND the freshness window's far edge, to
// absorb clock skew between the signer (our control-plane app) and this Worker. A replay
// arriving right at the window boundary under a little skew must still be caught, so we keep
// the nonce slightly longer than strictly required. Kept small: a nonce older than the
// window is already rejected by the timestamp check, so it need not outlive the window by
// much.

 * A job with timestamp T passes dispatch-verify's window check only while
 * now <= T + FRESHNESS_WINDOW_SECONDS, so the LAST instant a replay of that job could still
 * verify is T + FRESHNESS_WINDOW_SECONDS. We retain the nonce until then, plus a skew
 * margin. Deriving the expiry from the JOB TIMESTAMP — not "now + window" — guarantees the
 * nonce lives for the entire span in which its job is replayable, regardless of when we
 * first saw it. Beyond that instant the timestamp check rejects the job on its own, so the
 * row can be pruned without weakening the guarantee.

   * — surfacing as a rejected consume() and, in handleActuate, a non-200 with no actuation —
   * rather than silently letting the job through. Because /actuate routes every request to
