// Two projects, run in one `vitest` invocation:
//
//  • "node"    — the pre-existing pure-unit + validator/app-client/routing tests. They mock
//                `fetch` with vi.spyOn and never touch the Durable Object, so they stay on
//                the fast Node runtime exactly as before. Because they import the Worker
//                entry (which now transitively imports the workerd built-in
//                "cloudflare:workers"), the Node project aliases that module to a stub — the
//                DO is never instantiated here.
//
//  • "workers" — the NEW tests that must run under the REAL workerd runtime: the NonceStore
//                Durable Object (SQLite storage), the /actuate replay end-to-end, and edge
//                ed25519 crypto. Bindings + the DO SQLite migration come from wrangler.toml.
